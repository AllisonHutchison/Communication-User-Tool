After making your selection, our tool will show you a graph of the communication skills that show up most often in job ads for the selected job field so you can learn about the most important communication skills for that job.</p>\n                <p className=\"home_text dir\">OR</p>\n                <p className=\"home_text dir\">Resume analysis: Paste the content of your resume into our tool along with a job title or job description, and we will give you a score showing how successful your resume is in reflecting your communication skills. We will also show a graph comparing the most commonly appearing communication skills in ads for the selected job with how frequently the skill appears in your resume, so that you can reflect on your own communication skills and resume and make changes accordingly!</p>\n                <p className=\"home_text\">Also, feel free to check out our team on the About Us page!</p>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"purpose\">\n                <h3>Purpose Statement</h3>\n                <p className=\"home_text\">This Communication Job Skills tool aims at providing career-seeking engineering students with a way to gain a better understanding of what communication skills employers are looking for in a candidate so that users can evaluate and improve their own resumes and skill sets.</p>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"background\">\n                <h3>Background</h3>\n                <div className=\"home_text\">\n                    <p>Engineering students face a lack of technical communication skills in line with job requirements, reflected by both students in the recruitment process and alumni in the workforce [<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2001.tb00660.x\">1</a>, <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6087194/\">2</a>].

However, it has been found that engineers are unhappy with the level of their communication skills in their professions, despite the fact that approximately 64% of their time working is spent communicating [<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2001.tb00660.x\">1</a>]. Research has also shown that employers are generally dissatisfied with the technical communication skills of newly hired college graduate employees in multiple areas, including verbal and written communication, self-expression, and electronic media [<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2161-1920.2005.tb00893.x\">4</a>]. However, since engineering careers require strong communication skills in order to be successful, and long-term job success is significantly more dependent on the presence of soft-skills than technical skills [<a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/docview/1434861330\">5</a>], these students are unfortunately not fulfilling their potential to succeed in the workplace. This unfulfilled potential may stem from the fact that engineering students typically do not realize the importance of building their communication skills, instead focusing on building strong technical skills, since many students do not recognize the communication skills needed for their desired career [<a href=\"https://peer.asee.org/why-industry-says-that-engineering-graduates-have-poor-communication-skills-what-the-literature-says\">6</a>]. It has also been found that colleges are often limited in their teaching of technical writing courses aimed at preparing engineering students for communication in a professional setting [<a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6087194\">7</a>]</p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"project_scope\">\n                <h3>Project Scope</h3>\n                <div className=\"home_text\">\n                    <p>As skill mismatches often lead to negative impacts on job performance [<a href=\"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/IJM-05-2013-0116/full/html\">8</a>], we’re offering a solution that will help students gain a better understanding of the communication skills necessary for certain careers.

Although this project currently doesn’t address how engineering students should improve on their communication skills, it achieves the initial objective of emphasizing the importance of communication capabilities in the workplace and will encourage the engineering students to strengthen their desired talents.
