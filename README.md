This is an application built with a React frontend and a Flask backend. As such, several dependencies will need to be installed in order to run the application locally.

Firstly, make sure you make a Github account and install git on your machine. This can be done through following the steps laid out on the following links:

https://github.com/
​​https://github.com/git-guides/install-git

After you have completed the above steps, create a folder into which you wish to clone this repository. Then, navigate to that folder using your machine’s terminal (using “cd” to change directory and “ls” to view the contents of the current directory). A explanation of how to do this is given in the following link:

In this folder, clone the repository by running the command: git clone https://github.com/roninsharma25/Communication-User-Tool.git

Next, go into this directory by running the following command in your terminal:
cd Communication-User-Tool

Install the necessary dependencies using this command in your terminal: npm install

Start up the backend by running the following command in your terminal: npm run start-api
Finally, make a new terminal window, navigate to the project’s folder, and start up the frontend by running the following command in your terminal: npm start
